                    <h3>The Abbey Gate</h3>
                    <p>Originally the gateway between the part of Reading Abbey open to the public and the area reserved
                        for monks. It survived the 1539 dissolution of the Abbey and was turned into Royal lodgings.
                        Queen Elizabeth I was a regular visitor. It was later used as a schoolroom by Reading Ladies
                        Boarding School (including the future novelist Jane Austin circa 1795). Falling into a state of
                        disrepair, it was heavily restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1861
                        and is now a grade 1 listed building.

                    <p>Active between 1121 and 1538 the abbey was home to monks of the Benedictine order and one of the
                        largest abbeys in Europe. It owned extensive lands and formed a major economic hub of the area.

                    <h3>Forbury hill</h3>
                    <p>The exact origins of the hill are disputed. Theories range from a Viking camp to an early Motte
                        and Bailey castle. It is certain Forbury Hill was part of the towns defences in the siege of
                        reading (1642-43), where it was used as a gun emplacement.
