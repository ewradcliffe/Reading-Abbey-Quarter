                    <h3>The Abbey Gate</h3>
                    <p>Originally the gateway between the part of Reading Abbey open to the public and the area reserved
                        for monks. It survived the 1539 dissolution of the Abbey and was turned into Royal lodgings.
                        Queen Elizabeth 1st was a regular visitor. It was later used as a schoolroom by Reading Ladies
                        Boarding School (including the future novelist Jane Austin circa 1795). Falling into a state of disrepair, it was heavily restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1861
                        and is now a grade 1 listed building.
