                <h3>The Abbey Gate</h3>
                <p>Originally the gateway between the part of Reading Abbey open to the public and the area reserved
                    for monks. It survived the 1539 dissolution of the Abbey and was turned into Royal lodgings.
                    Queen Elizabeth I was a regular visitor. It was later used as a schoolroom by Reading Ladies
                    Boarding School (including the future novelist Jane Austen circa 1795). Falling into a state of
                    disrepair, it was heavily restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1861
                    and is now a grade 1 listed building.

                <h3>The Abbey Ruins</h3>
                <p>Active between 1121 and 1538 the abbey was home to monks of the Benedictine order and one of the
                    largest abbeys in Europe. It owned extensive lands and formed a major economic hub of the area.

                <h3>Forbury Hill</h3>
                <p>The exact origins of the hill are disputed. Theories range from a Viking camp to an early Motte
                    and Bailey castle. It is certain Forbury Hill was part of the towns defences in the siege of
                    reading (1642-43), where it was used as a gun emplacement.
